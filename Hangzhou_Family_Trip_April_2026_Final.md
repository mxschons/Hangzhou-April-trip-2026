**A Personal Welcome from Your Host**

Dear Esteemed Travelers,

On behalf of **MxSchons Tours** — the world's most exclusive invite-only travel agency (membership: 5 people, waiting list: also 5 people) — I am absolutely thrilled to present to you this meticulously crafted journey to Hangzhou!

We have combined the best of the best to ensure you have an absolutely *legendary* experience. From soaring over West Lake in a helicopter (yes, really!) to picking tea leaves like ancient emperors, from watching 700,000 LEDs light up the night sky to getting lost in magical water towns — this trip has it all.

Our team of experts (me, with help from Claude) has spent countless hours researching the finest restaurants, the most photogenic spots, and the perfect balance of adventure and relaxation. We've thought of everything: vegetarian options for certain picky eaters, massage breaks for tired feet, and strategic cafe stops for Chinese study sessions.

This isn't just a trip. This is a *MxSchons Tours Experience™*.

Pack your bags. Charge your cameras. Prepare your appetites.

Hangzhou awaits!

With excitement and anticipation,

**Max**\
*Founder, CEO, and Chief Adventure Officer*\

*P.S. — No refunds. You're family.*
